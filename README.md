# Eternal Hunt

## Overview

The Eternal Hunt is a massive content pack that includes new animations, scenes, enemies, items, armor, weapons, lore, effects, pseudo-quests, and much, much more. 

EH also features a great number of additional support systems as well, such as real-time meditation, auto-hide weapons for cloaks, wearable pocket items, blood/gore system, 3D quest markers, weather system, ice-breath etc. 

These are completely re-made by yours truly in a very merge-friendly way and will not conflict with the original mod that inspired them, though it is redundant to install the original on top of EH since it does all of them and more.

This mod is designed for those that have already finished the game and want to experience it again. It is absolutely not recommended for a first playthrough.

If you choose to use EH, I encourage you to fully explore the mod menu, for there are a great number of features.


## Combat

### Animation System:

EH is primarily combat-oriented, as it is the natural successor to the Advanced Combat System, and includes all of its features.

However, the default ACS setting applied on install is Equipment Mode, meaning that unique weapon animations will only apply to the player’s currently held weapon.

EH adds over 100+ weapons into the game, including but not limited to swords, spears, halberds, two-handed axes, greatswords, maces, daggers, scythes, staffs, etc. 

Among these weapons include special ones, such as Imlerith’s hammer and Eredin’s sword as well.

With Equipment Mode selected, these drop from enemies, with steel versions dropping from red-health enemies, and silver versions dropping from silver-health enemies. 

Equipment Mode also supports a vast majority of custom DLC weapon mods made by other people available on Nexus, if applicable.

Each of these weapons have their own specific moveset, giving the player the freedom to choose however they want to play the game.

Naturally, as EH has all of the features of ACS, it also includes Armiger, Focus, and Hybrid mode, which the specifics are detailed in the ACS mod page separately. 

EH also supports potion drinking and eating animations when using quick items.

Aside from the weapon-based animation system, each Witcher school has their own custom moveset (attacks, dodges, stance, etc)  if the player is using the default Witcher moveset. Only applies when wearing boots, armor, gloves, and pants belonging to the same school, regardless of tier, and then using the school's medallion that becomes available in the quickslots.

In addition, EH has animation override features that can be enabled/disabled to fully take over the vanilla Geralt sword animations, dodge animations, and roll animations. This system allows for quick animation canceling with minimal delay input. By default, this system is enabled, though can be disabled in the menus.

The override feature is capable of letting the player customize their own rolls and dodges for each cardinal direction.

EH also provides multiple options for passive taunting animations, alternate sword-walk animations, potion and food eating/drinking animations, and much more. These can all be enabled/disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu. 



### Stamina System:

EH allows the user to fully customize stamina consumption and stamina regeneration delay on various actions, such as attacks, dodges, parries etc. though its own custom menu.

Parrying now consumes stamina by default, and stamina consumption increases depending upon the type of body armor the player wears. 

The player’s guard will break if the player runs out of stamina.


### Parry System:

This system allows the player to perform different moves by binding the parry/counter button with different directional input keys.

By default, Forward + parry/counter will perform a counter attack on command, which is determined by the player’s current moveset. 

Left or Right + parry/counter will perform a shoulderbash or push, which is capable of staggering enemies if it connects. 

Light attack + parry/counter will perform a dagger strike, where the player will proceed to pull out a dagger. This deals a small percentage of the player’s current weapon damage.

Forward + doubletap parry/counter will result in a kick, which is also capable of staggering enemies if it connects. If the player has specialized daggers in their inventory, this command instead throws them.

Aside from the kick button, all inputs can be modified in the Combat Settings ---> Counter/Parry Settings menu.

### Finisher System:

EH allows for the player to customize which finisher they want to perform on humans through directional input. 

The inputs can be modified in the Custom Finishers menu in Combat Settings. 

By default:

- No directional key held will perform a torso finisher.
- Forward key held down will perform a stab finisher.
- Back key held down will perform a neck finisher.
- Right key held down will perform a head finisher from the right side.
- Left key held down will perform a head finisher from the left side.
- Right key + Forward key will perform an arm finisher from the right side.
- Left key + Forward key will perform an arm finisher from the left side.
- Right key + Back key will perform a leg finisher from the right side.
- Left key + Back key will perform a leg finisher from the left side.

In addition, auto-finishers are enabled by default for select monster types, such as nekkers and drowners. 

If playing on Death March (highest difficulty), when a finisher is performed near other enemies, the player is healed for a small percentage of their missing health.


### Sneaking:

If this option is enabled in the Combat Settings menu, holding down the witcher sense button and turning with the forward key held down while a weapon is drawn will enter sneaking mode.

The player becomes difficult to detect for enemies while sneaking, unless passing through their field of vision. Enemy field of vision decreases when raining. 


### Enemy AI:

Enemies in EH are very aggressive, but are also smart and learn from the player’s actions, and will alter their aggressiveness depending on their current health, who the player is targeting, whether or not the player is dodging consecutively next to them, etc.

Enemy AI has been tuned to give the player a challenge no matter how insignificant the enemy might be.

### Rage system:

EH includes a special Rage system, akin to Sekiro’s Perilous attack system, which periodically flashes a red wolf symbol above enemies and the player. 

When marked, the enemy gains immunity to hit reactions and has increased damage reduction, and its next attack cannot be blocked except by alternate Quen (bubble). 

This attack also stuns or knocks the player down depending on the enemy’s size. 

However, if the attack is dodged at the right moment just before it lands, the enemy is instead stunned for a short period.

Additionally, as long as the rage system is enabled, the player is capable of parrying all attacks except for heavy attacks that would knock the player down, though will still take some chip damage accordingly.

The rage system can be disabled entirely or modified to a large extent in the Combat Settings ---> Rage Mechanic Settings menu.

### Reactive Dodging:

Dodging an enemy attack just before it lands will slow down time for a very short period of time. Can be enabled or disabled in the menus.

### Base Enemy Changes:

#### Humans:
Aside from base AI enhancements, EH also makes some  drastic changes to the behaviors of human type enemies. Apart from bandits and pirates, humans are capable of swapping behaviors based upon their health, including one-hand sword style, two-hand sword style, and shield.

Human type enemies are also capable of throwing bombs and daggers at mid range as well.

#### Drowners:
Drowners are capable of launching tentacle attacks at range, which may be parried, though will knock the player down if it connects.

#### Ghouls:
Ghouls and their subtypes are capable of launching projectile venom attacks, which can be lit on fire. Different types of ghouls have different patterns for venom attacks.

#### Wild hunt hounds:
Wild hunt hounds are capable of launching ice spikes from a distance, and will drop a delayed ice explosion upon death. 

#### Nekkers:
When three or more nekkers are present, the Nekker Guardian is summoned into battle, capable of healing surrounding nekkers by draining its own health.

#### Novigrad higher vampires:
The two Novigrad higher vampires are no longer katakans, but full-fledged higher vampires with unique abilities.

#### Werewolves:
Werewolves are capable of summoning three additional wolves during battle when they drop below 50% health.

#### Wolves:
Additionally, regular wolves are now neutral to the player unless the player gets too close. If they are killed, there is a chance they will spawn a shadow wraith if Garmr is alive on the map.

#### Wild hunt bosses:

Imlerith and Eredin now have increased damage resistance. 

### Additional Random Encounters:

EH adds custom encounters into the game, which can be enabled, disabled, or tweaked in the menus. 

#### Wild Hunt Event:

By default, there is a 10% chance that the Naglfar will appear in the sky every 14 minutes a short period after combat ends. If the player is not near a town, Wild Hunt Red Riders will portal in and give chase to the player after 7 seconds.

Red Riders give chase upon horses, and will ride towards the player. 

There is a small chance that Caranthir or Eredin himself will appear as well.

The members of the wild hunt cannot stay for long, and will despawn a short while after.

#### Night Hunter Event:

The Night Hunter stalks the player, with a chance of striking after every fight in Velen, Skellige, Kaer Morhen, and Toussaint. 

Its greatest strength lies not in its venomous claws, leaping strikes, psychic scream, or long range pounces, but in its ability to camouflage itself repeatedly in combat.

However, while camouflaged, the Night Hunter's hide is less durable, and thus more susceptible to attacks.

#### Forest God Shadow Event:

Shadows of Berstuk, the Forest God, has a chance of spawning after combat if the player is close to where Berstuk is currently located on the map. 

#### Assassins of the Profaned Ichor Event:

Alternate universe versions of wielders of the Elder Blood hunt the player across all maps, with a chance of spawning after every fight as well. They are capable of deploying smoke bombs and fast teleportation strikes at mid to close range.

When below 50% health, assassins are capable of summoning duplicates of themselves.

#### Additional World Encounters:

Aside from random encounters, EH adds over 30+ different types of unique custom enemies spread out all over the different maps within the game.

### Blood and Gore:

EH is also a full-fledged blood and gore mod, adding in custom color-coded blood spray and blood trails for all weapons, regardless of type. 

With EH installed, there is no need for any other blood mod. 

Blood trails change depending upon the enemy hit, and will cover the player in blood accordingly.

Additionally, depending on which finisher is used, humans will crawl on the ground for a short while after death. 

Blood spatter amount and amount of gore spawned with each kill can be customized in the Visual Settings menu. 

### Player Death Scene:

Upon player death, a special death cutscene will play, replacing the vanilla death animations. There are different variations of the death scene, some of which are triggered by specific events of the game.

### Unconsciousness:

If the player is defeated by a guard, the unconsciousness system will kick in, which is slightly faster than the vanilla one. The player will also lose a percentage of their total amount of money they currently possess.

### Damage:

The Damage Settings menu offers customization for fall damage, which is altered to only apply if the player drops from very high up. The damage is calculated through percentage max health.

The menu also provides customization to crossbow damage, where if the player thinks crossbows deal too little damage they can additionally increase it to deal percentage max health or percentage current health to enemies. 

## Visuals

### Darkness:

By default, night times with EH installed are much darker than normal. 

EH provides options to alter night time darkness, such as sunrise and sunset times, darkness intensity, and darkness blend time in the Additional Settings ---> Darkness Settings menu.

### Fog Generation:

EH is capable of generating fog on the map, though this may cause FPS drops for lower-end systems. This is disabled by default in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

### Crimson Moon:

By default, the default moon is gone from the sky and instead the Crimson Moon takes its place, located in a static position in the sky no matter night or day on all maps except for the isle of the mists. The second moon will only show up at night.

This can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

### Spiral Ribbons:

Ribbons of red and white light scour the land at all times.

This can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

This can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

### Hood:

By pressing the radial wheel button + the Potion 2 button (default button F on kb&m), the player may equip a hood on themselves. 

### Cloak:

By pressing the radial wheel button + the Potion 3 button (default button T on kb&m), the player may equip a cloak on themselves. If the player is in Skellige or the winter white orchard map, the cloak also comes with furs. The cloak changes depending on if Shades of Iron is installed or not.
By default, equipping the cloak will hide all weapons on the player’s back. This can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

The player can also enable/disable whether the cloak is removed upon entering combat, and re-equipped once out of combat, also in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

These cloak settings also work on cloaks from other mods, though only if the cloak is an item.

### Player Extra VFX:

By disabling this option in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu, the player may disable certain vfx, such as the euphoria yellow vfx or the adrenaline red vfx.

### Wearable Pocket Items:

By default, EH displays pocket items and bombs that the player currently has equipped directly on the player. 

The options to disable them and the options to alter their positioning can be found in the Additional Settings ---> Visual Settings menu.

### Enhanced Sign Symbols:

Casting any sign will create a symbol of that sign on the player’s hand. Igni and Aard vfx are also altered to be more intense. 

This can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu.

### Lightning:

Powerful lighting strikes occur at random locations during rainy or blizzard weather every 30 seconds. Entities struck are staggered, including the player.

Humans and horses will breathe out mist in cold locations, such as Kaer Morhen, Skellige, and Winter White Orchard. 

## HUD

### Witcher Sense:

Witcher sense can be customized to a small degree in the Additional Settings ---> Hud & Camera Settings menu, such as the option to use a different witcher sense camera that removes the default zoom, turning witcher sense into a toggle instead of holding down the button, or adjusting the dimness of witcher sense itself.

### Minimap, Quest, and Buffs modules:

By default, EH hides the minimap, quest, and buffs modules if the player is at full health. These are only displayed if witcher sense is active, or whenever the wolf’s head medallion is shown. Enabling them in Video ---> HUD configuration will revert them back to vanilla behavior. 

### 3D Map Markers:

By default, holding down witcher sense will display a 3D map marker for all available quest locations, the nearest point of interest on the map, and the user marker. The marker is displayed for 7 seconds after witcher sense is deactivated. The despawn time can be extended/shortened in the Additional Settings ---> Hud & Camera Settings menu. Setting the despawn time to 0 will disable the marker type.

Quest markers are colored a pale yellow. The currently tracked quest marker is colored gold. Markers for quests not located on the current map will instead be located on the nearest signpost. 

Points of interest markers are colored white. Only the closest one to the player will be displayed. Points of interest include bandit camps, treasure, monster nests, as well as EH custom monster locations.

The user marker is colored green. Will remove itself once the player has reached its approximate location.


## Miscellaneous Options

### Tracked Quest Switching:

Holding down the witcher sense button + the potion 1 or potion 2 button (default buttons R and F on kb&m) will track the previous or next tracked quests in the quest journal, allowing the player to track different quests without entering the menu. 

### Auto-win Gwent:

Enabling this option in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu will automatically win any gwent game.

### Marking books/notes as read:

Enabling this option in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu will automatically mark any new books or notes as read if the witcher sense button is held down.

### Meditation:

By default, EH provides real-time meditation by pressing the N key on kb&m, or by pressing the witcher sense button + the Potion 3 button (default button T on kb&m).

Single-pressing the key will only allow time to pass by. Inventory menu is disabled.

Double-tapping the key will spawn a campfire. Inventory menu is enabled, and the player will slowly regain health, as well as replenish potions.

Holding down the sprint key will pass by the time quicker. 

EH’s version of real-time meditation being bound to the N key can be disabled in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu, which will allow the user to use other meditation mods.

### Item Durability Always Max:

If this option is enabled in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu, holding down the witcher sense button will restore item durability to all items equipped. 

### Item Auto-Scaling:

EH is capable of scaling certain vanilla items to the player’s level so that the player can never out-level them. These items include all witcher armor pieces and certain weapons, such as Aerondight, Iris, and the Toussaint Knight’s Steel Sword. This is disabled by default in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu.

Rare EH items will always scale to the player’s level.

### Firesources On/Off:

If enabled in the Additional Settings ---> Miscellaneous Settings menu, pressing the cast sign button while witcher sense is active with either Igni or Aard selected will either light all fire sources around the player or extinguish them.

If the fire source is already lit, lighting them again will lock their interaction. Casting again will unlock them.

The same happens when extinguishing fire sources that are already extinguished. 

## Items

EH includes a wide variety of special items. 

Some are items capable of summoning companions, while others are weapons that grant powerful abilities to the player. 

Some are transformation items that are capable of turning the player into a completely different entity, such as a werewolf or a cursed toad. These are cursed items that will slowly poison the user in exchange for powerful abilities.

The full list, as well as how to obtain them, is detailed in the mod menu, under Glossary ---> Tutorials ---> Items.
