# Eternal Hunt

## Overview

The Eternal Hunt is a massive content pack that includes new animations, scenes, enemies, items, armor, weapons, lore, effects, pseudo-quests, a wide variety of support systems, and much, much more. 

The mod is designed for those that have already played the game all the way through and want it again, but with a fresh take on things. It is absolutely not recommended for a first playthrough.

If you choose to use this mod, I encourage you to fully explore the mod menu, for there are a great number of features.

## Combat

### Animation System:

EH is primarily combat-oriented, as it is the natural successor to the Advanced Combat System, and includes all of its features.

However, the default ACS setting applied on install is Equipment Mode, meaning that unique weapon animations will only apply to the player’s currently held weapon.

EH adds over 100+ weapons into the game, including but not limited to spears, halberds, two-handed axes, greatswords, maces, daggers, scythes, staffs, etc. 

Among these weapons include special ones, such as Imlerith’s hammer and Eredin’s sword as well.

With Equipment Mode selected, these drop from enemies, with steel versions dropping from red-health enemies, and silver versions dropping from silver-health enemies. 

Equipment Mode also supports a vast majority of custom DLC weapon mods available on Nexus, if applicable.

Each of these weapons have their own specific moveset, giving the player the freedom to choose however they want to play the game.

Naturally, as EH has all of the features of ACS, it also includes Armiger, Focus, and Hybrid mode, which the specifics are detailed in the ACS mod page separately. 

EH also supports potion drinking and eating animations when using quick items.

Aside from the weapon-based animation system, each Witcher school has their own custom moveset (attacks, dodges, stance, etc)  if the player is using the default Witcher moveset. Only applies when wearing boots, armor, gloves, and pants belonging to the same school, regardless of tier, and then using the school's medallion that becomes available in the quickslots.


### Stamina System:

EH allows the user to fully customize stamina consumption and stamina regeneration delay on various actions, such as attacks, dodges, parries etc. though its own custom menu.

Parrying now consumes stamina by default, and stamina consumption increases depending upon the type of body armor the player wears. 

The player’s guard will break if the player runs out of stamina.

### Parry System:

By holding down a directional key and pressing the parry/counter button, the player is able to perform a parry/counter-attack skill on command. The input can be modified in its own dedicated menu in the EH mod menu.

Each weapon type has its own parry moveset. 

### Finisher System:

EH allows for the player to customize which finisher they want to perform through directional input. 

The inputs can be modified in the Custom Finishers menu in Combat Settings. 

By default:

- No directional key held will perform a torso finisher.
- Forward key held down will perform a stab finisher.
- Back key held down will perform a neck finisher.
- Right key held down will perform a head finisher from the right side.
- Left key held down will perform a head finisher from the left side.
- Right key + Forward key will perform an arm finisher from the right side.
- Left key + Forward key will perform an arm finisher from the left side.
- Right key + Back key will perform a leg finisher from the right side.
- Left key + Back key will perform a leg finisher from the left side.

### Enemy AI:

Enemies in EH are very aggressive, but are also smart and learn from the player’s actions, and will alter their aggressiveness depending on their current health. 

Enemy AI has been tuned to give the player a challenge no matter how insignificant the enemy might be.

### Rage system:

EH includes a special Rage system, akin to Sekiro’s Perilous attack system, which periodically flashes a red wolf symbol above enemies and the player. 

When marked, the enemy gains immunity to hit reactions and has increased damage reduction, and its next attack cannot be blocked except by alternate Quen (bubble). 

This attack also stuns or knocks the player down depending on the enemy’s size. 

However, if the attack is dodged at the right moment just before it lands, the enemy is instead stunned for a short period.

Additionally, as long as the rage system is enabled, the player is capable of parrying all attacks except for heavy attacks that would knock the player down, though will still take some chip damage accordingly.

The rage system can be disabled in the menus.

### Reactive Dodging:

Doding an enemy attack just before it lands will slow down time for a very short period of time.

### Base Enemy Changes:

#### Humans:
Aside from base AI enhancements, EH also makes some  drastic changes to the behaviors of human type enemies. Apart from bandits and pirates, humans are capable of swapping behaviors based upon their health, including one-hand sword style, two-hand sword style, and shield.

Human type enemies are also capable of throwing bombs and daggers at mid range as well.

#### Drowners:
Drowners are capable of launching tentacle attacks at range, which may be parried, though will knock the player down if it connects.

#### Ghouls:
Ghouls and their subtypes are capable of launching projectile venom attacks, which can be lit on fire. Different types of ghouls have different patterns for venom attacks.

#### Wild hunt hounds:
Wild hunt hounds are capable of launching ice spikes from a distance, and will drop a delayed ice explosion upon death. 

#### Nekkers:
When three or more nekkers are present, the Nekker Guardian is summoned into battle, capable of healing surrounding nekkers by draining its own health.

#### Novigrad higher vampires:
The two Novigrad higher vampires are no longer katakans, but full-fledged higher vampires with unique abilities.

#### Werewolves:
Werewolves are capable of summoning three additional wolves during battle when they drop below 50% health.

#### Wolves:
Additionally, regular wolves are now neutral to the player unless the player gets too close. If they are killed, there is a chance they will spawn a shadow wraith if Garmr is alive on the map.

#### Wild hunt bosses:

Imlerith and Eredin now have increased damage resistance. 

### Additional Random Encounters:

EH adds custom encounters into the game, which can be enabled, disabled, or tweaked in the menus. 

#### Wild Hunt Event:

By default, there is a 10% chance that the Naglfar will appear in the sky every 14 minutes a short period after combat ends. If the player is not near a town, Wild Hunt Red Riders will portal in and give chase to the player after 7 seconds.

Red Riders give chase upon horses, and will ride towards the player. 

There is a small chance that Caranthir or Eredin himself will appear as well.

The members of the wild hunt cannot stay for long, and will despawn a short while after.

#### Night Hunter Event:

The Night Hunter stalks the player, with a chance of striking after every fight in Velen, Skellige, Kaer Morhen, and Toussaint. 

Its greatest strength lies not in its venomous claws, leaping strikes, psychic scream, or long range pounces, but in its ability to camouflage itself repeatedly in combat.

However, while camouflaged, the Night Hunter's hide is less durable, and thus more susceptible to attacks.

#### Forest God Shadow Event:

Shadows of Berstuk, the Forest God, has a chance of spawning after combat if the player is close to where Berstuk is currently located on the map. 

#### Additional World Encounters:

Aside from random encounters, EH adds over 30+ different types of unique custom enemies spread out all over the different maps within the game. 

Many of these are full-fledged boss encounters, with their own custom AI and deadly abilities.

The full list includes:

- Alexander, Lord of the Plague
- Berstuk, the Forgotten Forest God
- Blood Hyms
- Cat School Assassins
- The Cult of Melusine
- The Draug
- Draugirs
- The Duskwraith
- Fata Morgana, the Ancient Foglet
- The Fire Wyrm
- Garmr, Hound of the Infinite Darkness
- Ice Titans
- Incubi
- The Knightmare Eternum
- Loviatar, Matron of Decay
- Mulas
- The Nameless Demon
- The Omnes Moriendus
- The Opinicus Matriarch
- Rioghan of the Abyss
- Rogue Mages
- Svalblod, the Ursine God of War
- Vildkaarls (Berserkers)
- The Xeno Swarm

The specifics of each enemy type may be found in the Glossary section of the EH menu, under Bestiary ---> Additional World Encounters.

#### Special Encounters:

Special encounters are encounters that only spawn after fulfilling a specific requirement. 
These are challenging boss encounters of varying degrees.

The full list includes:

The Blade of the Unseen - Killing a bruxa.

Khagmar, Monster of the Unseen - Defeating the Blade of the Unseen three times in a row.

Melusine of the Storm, Scion of Fucusya - Defeating Melusine in Skellige or using Rioghan’s Amulet.

Volos, Bringer of Chaos - Destroying the Altar of the Chaos Flame found in all major maps.

The specifics of each enemy type may be found in the Glossary section of the EH menu, under Bestiary ---> Special Encounters.

### Blood and Gore:

EH is also a full-fledged blood and gore mod, adding in custom color-coded blood spray and blood trails for all weapons, regardless of type. 

With EH installed, there is no need for any other blood mod. 

Blood trails change depending upon the enemy hit, and will cover the player in blood accordingly.

Additionally, depending on which finisher is used, humans will crawl on the ground for a short while after death. 

### Player Death Scene:

Upon player death, a special death cutscene will play, replacing the vanilla death animations.

### Unconsciousness:

If the player is defeated by a guard, the unconsciousness system will kick in, which is slightly faster than the vanilla one. The player will also lose a percentage of their total amount of money they currently possess.
